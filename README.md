`{{mount}}` lazy loading route-less engines.

## Installation

```
ember install ember-lazy-mount
```

## Usage

### `{{lazy-mount}}` Component

- **`name`**: _`string`_ â€” The name of the engine to load
- **`model?`**: _`any`_ â€” Optional model that will be passed through to the engine

The `{{lazy-mount}}` component works just like the [`{{mount}}` helper](https://emberjs.com/api/ember/3.5/classes/Ember.Templates.helpers/methods/mount?anchor=mount).
It accepts the name of the engine as a positional parameter and also an optional
`model` parameter.

As soon as the helper is rendered, it will begin loading the specified engine.
If the engine is already loaded, it will be mounted immediately.

The `engineName` and `model` parameters are dynamic and you can update them.
Setting a new `engineName` will cause the new engine to be loaded and mounted.

#### Inline Usage

While the engine is loading, nothing is rendered. If there was an error loading
the engine, nothing is rendered.

```hbs
{{lazy-mount engineName model=optionalDataForTheEngine}}
```

You can also pass three optional hooks:

```hbs
{{lazy-mount
  this.engineName
  onLoad=this.onLoad
  didLoad=this.didLoad
  onError=this.onError
}}
```

- **`onLoad()`** â€” Called when the engine starts loading
- **`didLoad()`** â€” Called when the engine loaded successfully
- **`onError(error: Error)`** â€” Called when the engine failed to load

#### Block Usage

While the engine is loading or if there was an error loading the engine, the
block that is passed to the component is rendered. The `engine` block parameter
is an object with two properties:

- **`isLoading`**: _`boolean`_ â€” Whether or not the engine is currently loading
- **`error`**: _`Error | null`_ â€” If there was an error loading the engine

When the engine was loaded successfully, the passed in block is replaced by the
engine.

```hbs
{{#lazy-mount engineName model=optionalDataForTheEngine as |engine|}}
  {{#if engine.isLoading}}
    ðŸ•‘ The engine is loading...
  {{else if engine.error}}
    ðŸ˜¨ There was an error loading the engine:
    <code>{{engine.error}}</code>
  {{/if}}
{{/lazy-mount}}
```

You can also pass in the same hooks: `onLoad`, `didLoad`, `onError`
