/**
 * The `{{lazy-mount}}` component works just like the
 * [`{{mount}}` helper](https://emberjs.com/api/ember/3.5/classes/Ember.Templates.helpers/methods/mount?anchor=mount).
 *
 * It accepts the name of the engine as a positional parameter and also an
 * optional `model` parameter.
 *
 * As soon as the helper is rendered, it will begin loading the specified
 * engine. If the engine is already loaded, it will be mounted immediately.
 *
 * The `engineName` and `model` parameters are dynamic and you can update them.
 * Setting a new `engineName` will cause the new engine to be loaded and mounted.
 *
 * #### Inline Usage
 *
 * While the engine is loading, nothing is rendered. If there was an error
 * loading the engine, nothing is rendered.
 *
 * ```hbs
 * {{lazy-mount engineName model=optionalDataForTheEngine}}
 * ```
 *
 * #### Block Usage
 *
 * While the engine is loading or if there was an error loading the engine, the
 * block that is passed to the component is rendered. The `engine` block
 * parameter is an object with two properties:
 *
 * - **`isLoading`**: _`boolean`_ â€” Whether or not the engine is currently
 *   loading
 * - **`error`**: _`Error | null`_ â€” If there was an error loading the engine
 *
 * When the engine was loaded successfully, the passed in block is replaced by
 * the engine.
 *
 * ```hbs
 * {{#lazy-mount engineName model=optionalDataForTheEngine as |engine|}}
 *   {{#if engine.isLoading}}
 *     ðŸ•‘ The engine is loading...
 *   {{else if engine.error}}
 *     ðŸ˜¨ There was an error loading the engine:
 *     <code>{{engine.error}}</code>
 *   {{/if}}
 * {{/lazy-mount}}
 * ```
 *
 * @class LazyMountComponent
 * @param {string} name Name of the engine to mount.
 * @param {any} [model] Object that will be set as
 *                      the model of the engine.
 * @public
